Description: The goal of this project is to create a dashboard designed to visualize TV series data over time, focusing on the change in two important indicators of an episodeâ€™s success, the average rating (indicating how well-received an episode is) and the number of votes (indicating how popular an episode is), in order to provide insights on viewership trends and present a narrative of how shows have resonated with the audience throughout their run. The interactive dashboard was created using Plotly Dash and uses data provided by IMDb, one of the largest online databases for films and television series related information.
